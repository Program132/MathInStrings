# MathInStrings

Welcome to this repositoty, _MathInString_ has a function to convert a math text in a math calculation.

I advise you to look at the code to understand the goal.

# Example

In the main function, you will get some example to understand how it works.

# Installation

You can copy and paste the function *_mathFinalValue_* anywhere and edit the name.
By the way, I advise you to copy others functions in the code to do not get any errors!

# End

ENJOY !
